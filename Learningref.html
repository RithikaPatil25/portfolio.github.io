                       <li><p><b>	What are the kinds of problems we see in the nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</b>	</p></li>
                    </ul><p>Iterative processes can be observed in phenomena like seasonal changes, where the cycle of spring, summer, autumn, and winter repeats in a predictable manner. Similarly,Recursion is evident in patterns that exhibit self-similarity, such as fractals seen in snowflakes, fern leaves, and coastlines. The branching of trees, where each branch splits into smaller branches, exemplifies a recursive process.Backtracking is a strategy often used in problem-solving scenarios in nature. For instance, birds and animals searching for nesting sites may explore multiple locations, retreating and trying again if a site proves unsuitable.</p>

                        <li><p><b>	What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth</b>	</p></li>
                    </ul><p>Space and time efficiency are fundamental concepts in the study of algorithms, referring to how effectively an algorithm utilizes memory (space) and execution time (time) to solve a given problem. Space efficiency involves minimizing the amount of memory an algorithm requires during its execution, while time efficiency focuses on reducing the duration it takes for the algorithm to complete its task.Algorithms are classified based on their </p>

   <p>complexity and growth rates, which describe how their resource requirements scale with input size. Constant time algorithms (O(1)) complete their operations in a fixed amount of time, regardless of input size. Logarithmic time algorithms (O(log n)) grow slowly, as seen in binary search, making them suitable for large datasets. Linear time algorithms (O(n)) scale proportionally with input size, often used for tasks like traversing a list. Linearithmic time algorithms (O(n log n)), such as merge sort, are efficient for sorting. Quadratic (O(n²)) and higher polynomial time algorithms (O(n³), etc.) grow much faster, often arising from nested loops or complex operations. Exponential (O(2ⁿ)) and factorial (O(n!)) time algorithms grow rapidly and are generally impractical for large inputs due to their steep resource demands.

   </p>
    <ul><li><p><b>Take away from different design principles from chapter 2 (can use the notes provided)</b></p></li></ul>
    <p>Chapter 2 introduces key design principles that are fundamental to creating efficient and effective algorithms. These principles serve as a guide for solving computational problems in a structured and scalable manner. The divide and conquer approach focuses on breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their solutions. This principle is commonly used in sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort and searching algorithms like binary search.The greedy algorithm principle works by making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of reaching a globally optimal solution. While it may not always guarantee the best result, it performs well in problems like minimum spanning trees and activity selection. Similarly, backtracking explores all possible solutions incrementally and abandons paths that cannot lead to a valid result, making it suitable for constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku and the N-Queens problem. The recursion principle solves problems by defining them in terms of simpler instances of themselves, making it an elegant solution for inherently recursive problems.</p>
            <ul><li><p><b>The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</b></p></li></ul>
        <p>Hierarchical data structures, such as trees, provide an efficient way to represent and manage hierarchical relationships in data.The binary tree is the simplest form, with each node having at most two children. It serves as the foundation for more specialized trees. The binary search tree (BST) organizes data such that the left subtree contains smaller values and the right subtree larger ones, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.However, BSTs can become unbalanced, degrading performance to O(n) in the worst case.AVL trees and red-black trees maintain balance through rotation operations. AVL trees enforce a strict balance factor, ensuring logarithmic height at the cost of additional rotations during updates. Red-black trees, on the other hand, allow a more relaxed balancing mechanism, making them slightly faster for insertions and deletions while still guaranteeing O(log n) operations.The 2-3 tree is a multi-way balanced search tree where each node can have two or three children. It keeps all paths from the root to the leaves of equal length, ensuring balance and consistent performance.The heap is a specialized tree used in priority queues and sorting algorithms. In a max-heap, the parent node is greater than or equal to its children, ensuring the highest priority element is always accessible at the root. The trie is a prefix tree that excels in string searching and retrieval problems. It stores characters as nodes, optimizing operations like autocomplete, dictionary lookups, and longest prefix matching.</p>    
    <ul><li><p><b>The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</b></p></li></ul>    
    <p>Array query algorithms are essential for efficiently retrieving and processing data stored in arrays, a fundamental data structure in computer science. These algorithms address common operations such as finding sums, minimums, maximums, or other properties of subarrays. Without optimized query techniques, performing such operations on large datasets can result in significant computational overhead. </p>
       <ul><li><p><b>Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each</b></p></li></ul>
       <p>Trees and graphs are essential data structures with distinct characteristics, traversals, and applications.The main difference between them lies in their connectivity and edge relationships. In a tree, there is exactly one path between any two nodes, ensuring a connected structure with 
        𝑛
        −
        1
        n−1 edges for 
        𝑛
        n nodes. A graph can be either connected or disconnected, with a potentially unlimited number of edges.<br>In trees, the most common traversals are preorder, where the root is visited first, followed by the left and right subtrees; inorder, which visits the left subtree, root, and right subtree; and postorder, which visits the left and right subtrees before the root. Level-order traversal, used in trees, explores nodes level by level. Graphs, on the other hand, can be traversed using Depth-First Search (DFS), which explores nodes as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, or Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving to the next level.</p>
      <ul><li><p><b>Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world</b></p></li></ul>
        <p>The most commonly known sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Each algorithm uses a different technique to arrange data. For example, Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, while Quick Sort uses a divide-and-conquer approach, selecting a pivot element and partitioning the dataset into two halves that are recursively sorted. Merge Sort also employs divide-and-conquer, recursively breaking down the list and merging the sorted sublists. Selection Sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and places it in the correct position, and Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time, inserting each new element in its correct position in the already sorted part of the list.These algorithms connect to real-world applications in numerous ways. Sorting algorithms are essential for tasks like organizing data in databases, searching records, or displaying results in a particular order. For example, in an e-commerce website, sorting algorithms are used to display products in order of price, popularity, or rating. In search engines, sorting is critical to rank results based on relevance and authority. </p>
